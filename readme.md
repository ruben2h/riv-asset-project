## Installation Requirements

This README specifies the hardware and software requirements, as well as the versions in which the project has been developed and executed.

### Hardware Requirements

The project has been developed using Visual Studio Code as the IDE and the IBM Blockchain Platform plugin, which in turn requires Docker to be installed. Although Docker Desktop for Windows does not specify a minimum processor level, we have found that not every processor/computer is sufficient for its operation, experiencing overheating and lagging problems. Therefore, the minimum hardware requirements to overcome these issues are:

-   16 GB of RAM
-   6-core processor or higher
-   120 GB of free SSD disk space

### Software Requirements

Although we have used various versions during its development, we propose the latest versions that have been used, listing them alongside their corresponding version.

-   Microsoft Windows 10 version 21H2
-   Visual Studio Code version 1.64.2
-   IBM Blockchain Platform
-   Docker Desktop for Windows version 4.2.0*
-   Node.js version 16.14.0
